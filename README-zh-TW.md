# Arin Slate – AI Orchestrator / AI Workflow Portfolio

## 1. 簡要介紹（Summary）

I work as an **AI Orchestrator / AI Workflow Architect**,  
designing how humans, data, systems and multiple LLMs collaborate under a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**.

My background combines:
- enterprise consulting (financial / planning systems),
- modular system design (Core Kernel + Modules),
- and behavioral / cognitive insights applied to product design.

This portfolio highlights:
- my **R0 / AI Orchestrator methodology**, and  
- several real projects where I applied it as a one-person operator.

- SSOT and Core Kernel vs. Modules  
- L1–L10 layered collaboration model  
- End-to-end orchestration workflow  
- Applied examples (Remote Life OS, Side Hustle Dashboard, City Intel Map Kernels)
