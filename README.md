# AI Orchestrator / R0 Workflow Portfolio – Arin Slate

[English](./README.md) | [繁體中文 / Traditional Chinese](./README-zh-TW.md)

---

## 1. Summary

I work as an **AI Orchestrator / AI Workflow Architect**,  
designing how humans, data, systems and multiple LLMs collaborate under a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**.

My background combines:

- Enterprise consulting experience (financial / planning systems),
- Modular system design (Core Kernel + Modules),
- Behavioral and cognitive insights applied to product and workflow design.

This repo collects:

- My **R0 / AI Orchestrator methodology**, and  
- Several real projects where I applied it as a one-person operator.

It is intended as a **portfolio for AI-related PM / strategy / workflow architect roles**.
