## 1. Project Context

- **Project name:** Side Hustle Value Dashboard  
- **Timeframe:** 2024 (multiple iterations)  
- **Role:** Product Strategist / AI Orchestrator / System Designer  
- **Domain:** Side hustle management, one-person business strategy, personal analytics  

Many people run side hustles and feel constantly busy, but:

- They cannot clearly see where their time and energy go,  
- They don’t know which projects truly create value,  
- They rarely define a clear end-point for “this experiment is over”.

This project aims to build a **dashboard + experiment framework** that makes:

> “Where did my time, energy, money and learning go?”  
> visible and comparable across different side hustles.

---

## 2. Problem Definition

Core problem:

> Side hustle activities are scattered and unstructured,  
> making it hard to evaluate “Is this worth it?” and to decide what to stop or double down on.

Specific pain points:

- Tasks can be listed in a to-do app,  
  but experiments rarely have clear **end conditions**.
- It is difficult to look back and ask:
  - Which side hustles actually produced revenue, learning, assets or network?
- There is no standard way to record and compare side hustles over time.

## 3. My Role: AI Orchestrator / System Designer

In this project I:

- Defined the structure of a **side hustle slot / experiment**:
  - A slot represents a theme (e.g., map products, AI consulting, a content series),
  - Each slot has a 4–8 week experimental cycle.

- Designed the **SSOT for side hustles**:
  - Time investment (hours),
  - Energy / stress / enjoyment signals,
  - Money (costs, revenue),
  - Intangible outcomes (skills, assets, relationships).

- Used AI to:
  - Analyze common side-hustle patterns and failure modes,
  - Co-design the schema of the dashboard,
  - Generate report narratives and reflection prompts.

## 4. Solution Design & Workflow

### 4.1 Data Model

Key entities:

- `hustle_slot`  
  - One side hustle theme (with start/end dates, goals, hypothesis).

- `hustle_session`  
  - A single work session (date, duration, type of work, subjective energy).

- `hustle_value`  
  - Outcomes such as revenue, leads, assets created, audience growth.

- `hustle_experiment`  
  - Experiment-level data: initial hypothesis, metrics, observations, decisions.

This structure makes it possible to:

- Compare different side hustles on a common basis,  
- Ask: “Which slots are consuming time but not producing value?”

### 4.2 AI Orchestration

AI is used at several steps:

- **L1–L2: Pattern & KPI discovery**
  - Ask AI to summarize global patterns:
    - typical side hustle types,
    - common reasons people burn out or fail,
    - useful metrics beyond just revenue (learning, portfolio, network).  
  - Use this to define the schema and KPIs.

- **L3: Dashboard & report drafts**
  - Ask AI to suggest:
    - dashboard views,
    - key charts and tables,
    - templates for monthly or end-of-experiment reports.

- **L4: Consistency checks**
  - Ask AI to detect missing or inconsistent records:
    - e.g., slots with many sessions but no recorded outcomes,
    - unbalanced time vs. value profiles.

## 5. Experiments & Iterations

I applied this framework to my own side hustles, including:

- Map kernel products,  
- Remote Life OS modules,  
- AI consulting / documentation services.

For each slot:

1. Use AI to help write a clear hypothesis and success criteria;  
2. Log sessions and outcomes in the defined schema;  
3. At the end of 4–8 weeks:
   - Ask AI to generate a summary report draft,
   - Edit and finalize the decision: continue, pivot, or stop.

The process itself is an exercise in **AI Orchestration + Experiment Management**.

## 6. Outcomes & Learnings

Outcomes:

- A reusable **side-hustle experiment framework** (slots + experiments + dashboard),  
- A concrete way to turn “I feel busy” into structured data and decisions.

Key learnings:

- Many side hustles don’t need a perfect product;  
  they need a **clear experiment end-point** and a structured review.
- With proper records, it becomes much easier to:
  - stop low-value projects without guilt,
  - double down on promising ones.
- This same experiment structure can be reused for:
  - new product ideas in Remote Life OS,
  - potential B2B offerings.

## 7. Enterprise Applicability

The Side Hustle Value Dashboard framework can be adapted to:

- **Internal innovation portfolios**  
  - Track initiatives as experiments rather than “projects that never die”.

- **GenAI PoC / pilot portfolios**  
  - Each PoC becomes a slot with defined metrics and an end decision.

- **Individual OKR / capability development**  
  - Make skill-building and internal side projects measurable.

In all these contexts, AI can be orchestrated to:

- Suggest experiments,  
- Generate reports,  
- Surface insights from the data,  

while a human R0 / PM owns the decision-making structure.
